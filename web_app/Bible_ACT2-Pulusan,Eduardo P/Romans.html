  <h3>Romans 1:1 - 1:32 </h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>{1:1} Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called [to be] an
apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, <br>{1:2} (Which he
had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)<br>
{1:3} Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was
made of the seed of David according to the flesh; <br>{1:4} And
declared [to be] the Son of God with power, according to
the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:<br>
{1:5} By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for
obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:<br>
{1:6} Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:<br>
{1:7} To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called [to be]
saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the
Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
{1:8} First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you
all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.<br>
{1:9} For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit
in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make
mention of you always in my prayers; <br>{1:10} Making
request, if by any means now at length I might have a
prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.<br>
{1:11} For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you
some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established; <br>{1:12}
That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the
mutual faith both of you and me. <br>{1:13} Now I would not
have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to
come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have
some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.<br>
{1:14} I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the
Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.<br> {1:15} So,
as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you
that are at Rome also. <br>{1:16} For I am not ashamed of the
gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to
every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the
Greek. <br>{1:17} For therein is the righteousness of God
revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall
live by faith.<br>
{1:18} For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven
against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who
hold the truth in unrighteousness; <br>{1:19} Because that
which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God
hath shewed [it] unto them.<br> {1:20} For the invisible things
of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being
understood by the things that are made, [even] his eternal
power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: <br>{1:21}
Because that, when they knew God, they glorified [him] not
as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their
imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. <br>{1:22}
Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,<br>
{1:23} And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into
an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and
fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.<br>
{1:24} Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness
through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own
bodies between themselves:<br> {1:25} Who changed the truth
of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature
more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.<br>
{1:26} For this cause God gave them up unto vile
affections: for even their women did change the natural use
into that which is against nature: <br>{1:27} And likewise also
the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in
their lust one toward another; men with men working that
which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that
recompence of their error which was meet. <br>{1:28} And
even as they did not like to retain God in [their] knowledge,
God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things
which are not convenient;<br> {1:29} Being filled with all
unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness,
maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit,
malignity; whisperers, {1:30} Backbiters, haters of God,
despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things,
disobedient to parents, <br>{1:31} Without understanding,
covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable,
unmerciful:<br> {1:32} Who knowing the judgment of God, that
they which commit such things are worthy of death, not
only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.</p>
