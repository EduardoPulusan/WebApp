  <h3>Ezekial 1:1 - 1:28</h3>
  <blockquote>
   <p>{1:1} Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the
fourth [month,] in the fifth [day] of the month, as I [was]
among the captives by the river of Chebar, [that] the
heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.<br> {1:2} In
the fifth [day] of the month, which [was] the fifth year of
king Jehoiachin’s captivity,<br> {1:3} The word of the LORD
came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in
the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand
of the LORD was there upon him. <br>{1:4} And I looked, and,
behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud,
and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness [was] about it,
and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of
the midst of the fire. <br>{1:5} Also out of the midst thereof
[came] the likeness of four living creatures. And this [was]
their appearance; they had the likeness of a man. <br>{1:6} And
every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.<br>
{1:7} And their feet [were] straight feet; and the sole of
their feet [was] like the sole of a calf’s foot: and they
sparkled like the colour of burnished brass. <br>{1:8} And [they
had] the hands of a man under their wings on their four
sides; and they four had their faces and their wings<br>{1:9}
Their wings [were] joined one to another; they turned not
when they went; they went every one straight forward.<br>
{1:10} As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the
face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and
they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four
also had the face of an eagle.<br> {1:11} Thus [were] their
faces: and their wings [were] stretched upward; two [wings]
of every one [were] joined one to another, and two covered
their bodies.<br> {1:12} And they went every one straight
forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; [and] they
turned not when they went.<br>{1:13} As for the likeness of the
living creatures, their appearance [was] like burning coals
of fire, [and] like the appearance of lamps: it went up and
down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright,
and out of the fire went forth lightning. <br>{1:14} And the
living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a
flash of lightning.<br>
{1:15} Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one
wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four
faces. <br>{1:16} The appearance of the wheels and their work
[was] like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one
likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were
a wheel in the middle of a wheel. <br>{1:17} When they went,
they went upon their four sides: [and] they turned not when
they went.<br>{1:18} As for their rings, they were so high that
they were dreadful; and their rings [were] full of eyes round
about them four.<br> {1:19} And when the living creatures
went, the wheels went by them: and when the living
creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were
lifted up. <br>{1:20} Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they
went, thither [was their] spirit to go; and the wheels were
lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living
creature [was] in the wheels. <br>{1:21} When those went,
[these] went; and when those stood, [these] stood; and when
those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted
up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature
[was] in the wheels.<br> {1:22} And the likeness of the
firmament upon the heads of the living creature [was] as the
colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads
above.<br> {1:23} And under the firmament [were] their wings
straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which
covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered
on that side, their bodies. <br>{1:24} And when they went, I
heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters,
as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the
noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their
wings.<br> {1:25} And there was a voice from the firmament
that [was] over their heads, when they stood, and had let
down their wings.<br>
{1:26} And above the firmament that [was] over their
heads [was] the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a
sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne [was] the
likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.<br> {1:27}
And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire
round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even
upward, and from the appearance of his loins even
downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it
had brightness round about. <br>{1:28} As the appearance of
the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so [was] the
appearance of the brightness round about. This [was] the
appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And
when I saw [it,] I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of
one that spake. </p>
