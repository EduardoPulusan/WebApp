  <h3>Acts 1:1 - 1:26 </h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>{1:1} The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of
all that Jesus began both to do and teach, <br>{1:2} Until the
day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy
Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he
had chosen:<br> {1:3} To whom also he shewed himself alive
after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of
them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the
kingdom of God: <br>{1:4} And, being assembled together with
[them,] commanded them that they should not depart from
Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which,
[saith he,] ye have heard of me. <br>{1:5} For John truly
baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy
Ghost not many days hence. <br>{1:6} When they therefore
were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt
thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? <br>{1:7}
And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times
or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.
<br>{1:8} But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost
is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in
Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the
uttermost part of the earth.<br> {1:9} And when he had spoken
these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a
cloud received him out of their sight. <br>{1:10} And while they
looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two
men stood by them in white apparel; <br>{1:11} Which also
said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into
heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into
heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him
go into heaven. <br>{1:12} Then returned they unto Jerusalem
from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a
sabbath dayâ€™s journey. <br>{1:13} And when they were come
in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both
Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and
Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James [the son] of
Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas [the brother] of
James. <br>{1:14} These all continued with one accord in
prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the
mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.<br>
{1:15} And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of
the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were
about an hundred and twenty,) <br>{1:16} Men [and] brethren,
this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the
Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning
Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.<br> {1:17} For
he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this
ministry.<br> {1:18} Now this man purchased a field with the
reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in
the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.<br> {1:19} And it was
known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that
field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to
say, The field of blood.<br> {1:20} For it is written in the book
of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man
dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take.<br> {1:21}
Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all
the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,<br>
{1:22} Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same
day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to
be a witness with us of his resurrection.<br> {1:23} And they
appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed
Justus, and Matthias. <br>{1:24} And they prayed, and said,
Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all [men,] shew
whether of these two thou hast chosen,<br> {1:25} That he may
take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas
by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.<br>
{1:26} And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon
Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</p>
